      <h3>Once upon a time</h3>
      <pre>Once upon a time I had a cycle,
A cycle I used to pedal.

Now, there's a bike, it's faster,
And there's no shoelaces, to meddle with the pedal.
But I miss the feeling of safety,
That I wouldn't be hurt, Dad wouldn't let me.


Once upon a time there was a cradle,
A cradle I was rocked in.
Later, it was a bed, where I was tucked in.

Now, it's a mess, and not the beautiful kind.
With bedsheets in one corner and pillow in another.
Where sleep is not found, in any damn corner!
I miss the gentle touch of my mom on my forehead.
The goodnight kisses, the bedtime stories,
The lullabies that led me to blissful sleeps.

Once upon a time there was an innocent, free, lively spirit.
A spirit that lived in me, one that'd go nuts behind butterflies, and run chasing fireflies.

Now, there's a burnt out hole in my chest.
That spirit burnt itself out,
Trying to outshine the darkness.
The darkness that world withheld,
of judgement, of should-dos and shouldn'ts.
What others would think and wouldn't.
Can't do nothing, nothing in the fleeting moment.
'cause you gotta think,
Think what a thousand brains would think!


Once upon a time world was a happy place.
With many free spirits, of singers, musicians, dancers, and artists.

Now, it's all just a never ending race.
A herd of doctors, engineers and CAs!
Chasing something they never wanted, in first place!


Wish I could go back, freeze in there.
Those moments that I miss, live them , and live in there.
When I used to cry so loud, but never hurt so bad.
When little things made me happy, not something glamorous and crappy.
When I had love so pure, a pair of hearts looking after, selflessly.

Wish I would wake up to that beautiful little world
And this all just be a damn nightmare.

      <h3>Drunk?</h3>
      <pre>When I am sober, I wish I was drunk,
Because there's this chunk, I wish was sunk.
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Hope?</h3>
      <pre>One hope is enough to delude you;
One hope is enough to run fro reality.

    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Scars</h3>
      <pre>Millions of stars,
Yet what stood out were her scars.
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Human Nature</h3>
      <pre>No one knows anyone,
Everyone knows some part of everyone,
If these parts were put together,
You'll find that it is not the whole,
ironically.
</pre>

    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Bullied</h3>
      <pre>Sensed a sound
Chased he felt
Like a squirrel he was
He ran, ran holding his nut
To a safe place

To protect the nut, from the nutcases
'Leave me alone', he cried.
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Judge-me-n-()-t</h3>
      <pre>He put on a face that people liked,
But he came home to his pet cats and books, so that's alright.
How he wished, he coud be the original him,
not being judged,
not being fright,
the world where people were like his cats and his loving books,
a perfect blend of the wild and the intellect!
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Lesson</h3>
      <pre>You are being a wrinkle, he said.
I am giving you wrinkles, I repled.
</pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class='poem'>
      <h3>Clutter</h3>
      <pre>We were conquering the world one day,
And parted our ways the other.
Surprising it is, how soon things could clutter!
</pre>
