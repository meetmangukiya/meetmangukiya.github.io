      Sensed a sound
      Chased he felt
      Like a squirrel he was
      He ran, ran holding his nut
      To a safe place

      He put on a face that people liked,
      But he came home to his pet cats and books, so that's alright.
      How he wished, he coud be the original him,
      not being judged,
      not being fright,
      the world where people were like his cats and his loving books,
      a perfect blend of the wild and the intellect!

      And parted our ways the other.
      Surprising it is, how soon things could clutter!
